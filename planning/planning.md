Monday evening notes: 
- I GOT THE INDEX WORK!!! 
- Notes about the database, look in the documentation and see you can find articles that are just in English. 
- It is really time to start looking at sytled components. If you can just get the home page and aRticle.js to look good you got MVP. 


Questions: 
- How do I take the image to URL and make it populate as the image. I think if I put it in a <img> that would do it, but I'm not sure. 
- Why can't you use styled-components in a child component?
