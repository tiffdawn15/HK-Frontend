Monday evening notes: 
- I GOT THE INDEX WORK!!! 
- Notes about the database, look in the documentation and see you can find articles that are just in English. 
- It is really time to start looking at sytled components. If you can just get the home page and aRticle.js to look good you got MVP. 


Questions: 
- How do I take the image to URL and make it populate as the image. I think if I put it in a <img> that would do it, but I'm not sure. 
- Why can't you use styled-components in a child component? 


Tuesday: 
- Morning: 
    - Try to finish db and get it on Mongo Atlas 
            - Update: Done did it 
- Afternoon: 
    - Hello styled components! I would like it if you made my shit pretty. 
      -   Update:  This was ignored for getting the fetch to work. I got stuck trying to get the props for articles to load. It shows everthing in the props, but not in
